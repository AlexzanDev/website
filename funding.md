    <h2>Our plans for Bottles</h2>
    <p>We have several plans for Bottles' future, many features that take time 
    and money to come true.</p>
    <h3>Wine build server</h3>
    <p>We would like to build and offer our own builds of Wine (and Proton?) To 
    have more control over what comes with Bottles.</p>
    <p>Building our builds allows us to have greater integration, register 
    releases with a checksum in order to verify their integrity, estimate their 
    weight before downloading and offer an ever better user experience.</p>
    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>Building a complete Wine build requires many resources and it is 
    necessary to configure a Workflow that manages the entire process 
    autonomously.</p>
    <p>Your donations will be used for the purchase of servers and their maintenance.</p>
    <br />
    <p>- Thanks from the Bottles Developers.</p>
